### Notes
Father Marcus is the Priest in Residence of the Church of Arthorne. It has been implied to me that his past is checkered and morally... compromised, but he does seem to hold the Christian virtues in high esteem. He has an alternate form where his skin is charcoal and has horns. He is rarely seen without his basket of pastries, which he will offer to you in his customarily soft-spoken voice.
