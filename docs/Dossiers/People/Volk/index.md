### Notes
Volk is a competent agent of the Church in Arthorne. He is knowledgable of many phenomena, and is sensible with when to withold information and when to share it. He has been placed as a ward of some sort under Father Marcus as punishment(?) for issues with his plans to defeat a demon. He seems a divisive figure amongst the town, but he and I get along well. I would hate for him to get hurt or perish, but he has a delicate constitution and a dispensation for throwing himself into dangerous situations that makes me worry.
