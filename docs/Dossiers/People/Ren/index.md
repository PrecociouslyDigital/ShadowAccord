### Notes
Ren is the right hand man to Father Marcus, his "intern," whatever that means. It seems to be some sort of apprentice situation, with Father Marcus instructing Ren in the usage of certain phenomena. Ironically, from conversation I infer that Father Marcus also looks to Ren as a spiritual and ethical guide. The priest instructing the lay on worldly matters, and the lay guiding the priest's spiritual matters... the jokes write themselves.

Ren is a "sorcerer" and his phenomena come from study. He claims that his magicks are compatible with his faith, and that I can also be taught in his tradition. I am yet to accept his offer, out of both caution and practical reasons..
