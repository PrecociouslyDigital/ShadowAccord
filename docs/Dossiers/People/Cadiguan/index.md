### Notes
Cadiguan is the tavern cook, one of the people new to town before me, ~~and as far as anyone can tell, completely mundane. Not only is he completely mundane, but he exhibits "Delirium," in which his mind enters fight or flight mode whenever he directly witnesses any phenomena. This both grants him speed and strength, but also causes his perception of phenomena to warp such that he percieves mundane explainations for the supernatural events. This is apparantly the default state for most of those who cannot manifest phenomena themselves^[why doesn't this happen to me?]. Between this delirium, his incredible cooking and his general good nature, most of the town sees him as someone to protect and shield from the general goings on. I cannot discount myself as one of these numbers, as he was the first friendly face when I came to Arthorne. ~~

Update: after a series of unfortunate events none of the above is true, and Cadiguan is now in blood thrall to Father Marcus. I have left the rest of this entry intact for posterity and reference, but I will likely have occassion to move that section and to fill out a more comprehensive list of phenomena at his disposal soon...

He is known to be good at hiding in foliage, and is quiet as a mouse while doing so. He is also, unfortunately, a half-decent pickpocket and canny thief if he so chooses to be. He is naturally cautious^[Not... quite cowardly], and accomplished at foraging.
