### Notes
Cadiguan is the tavern cook, one of the people new to town before me, and as far as anyone can tell, completely mundane. Not only is he completely mundane, but he exhibits "Delirium," in which his mind enters fight or flight mode whenever he directly witnesses any phenomena. This both grants him speed and strength, but also causes his perception of phenomena to warp such that he percieves mundane explainations for the supernatural events. This is apparantly the default state for most of those who cannot manifest phenomena themselves^[why doesn't this happen to me?]. Between this delirium, his incredible cooking and his general good nature, most of the town sees him as someone to protect and shield from the general goings on. I cannot discount myself as one of these numbers, as he was the first friendly face when I came to Arthorne. 

He is known to be good at hiding in foliage, and is quiet as a mouse while doing so.
