### Notes
Nora is one of the main bar staff at the Wandering Bear. She hails from Eire, and is firey, headstrong, and protective of those dear to her, as evidenced when she set an outlaw on fire in the Ploermel gaol. Despite this she is kind and warm, as evidenced by how she treated me when I was new in town. She is in the know to some extent, though I know not her general affiliation.
