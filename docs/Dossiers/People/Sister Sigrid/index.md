### Notes
Sister Sigrid is a Sister in service of the Church in Arthorne. Like most members of the church, her past is apparantly checkered; she is working on not seeing murder as the default solution to all problems. I am uncomfortable around her, as seeing her reminds me of ~~home~~ the abbey, and contrasts poorly with her casual relationship to violence. This unease is largely unfounded as she has not had any untoward reaction to me ~~yet~~.

Sister Sigrid is, according to the other church attaches the most formidable fighter of us all. I will have to find some time to witness this personally.
