## The Church of Arthorne
The Church of Arthrone is the, well, Christian^[still can't believe there are... pagans here.] Church in Arthorne. It is the organization with which I have aligned myself, ironically enough. 

### Supernatural properties
The building of the church has been consecreated, and thus it is a refuge in both the traditional ways and in several important supernatural ones:
- Ghosts can't cross the threshold
- Nor can demons

### Church Affiliates
- Father Marcus
- Ren
- Sister Sigrid
- Pick
- Volk
- Tiffany
