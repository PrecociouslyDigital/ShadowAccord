## Wandering Bear
The Wandering Bear is the tavern of Arthorne, a large well maintained central building. Victuals, Drinks and games can all be purchased with coin, and the kitchen is open for communal use. Events and gatherings happen every other month. I hear it is managed (or owned?) by Ingrid, but I often see Nora and directly managing the tavern floor itself.
