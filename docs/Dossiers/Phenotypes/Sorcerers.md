## Sorcerers
### Abstract
Sorcerers are humans that have learned some form of magick. 

### Description
Sorcerers is a descriptive term for any human who has manifested extraordinary phenomena through replicable study (hereafter magick). These practitioners command a wide and flexible range of phenomena, and may teach any phenomena they have mastered to students. However, they are physically mortal just like you or I, and have none of the extraordinary resliance you may find from the other phenotypes.

### Politics and Organization
Sorcerers are the most numerous Phenotype in Arthorne, but are also the most fractured. The divergent ways people become sorcerers also means that there is little common ground

- A group of largely pagan sorcerers gather often at the Rune and Rod.
- Another group appears to gather around the Healer's Guild.
- Yet another group comprises many of the craftsmen in town.
- ~~The final group of paramilitary bent call themselves the Barristers~~ The Barristers, while an organized group, are likely mostly not sorcerers in the traditional sense.

Making things even more confusing, membership in multiple clusters is not just permitted but common, and many non-sorcerers also fall into these clusters. It is likely most notable that there is not a single political entity commanding the loyalties of all sorcerers like there is for Ghosts and Vampires.

### Common Powers
- Memory Manipulation
- Lay on Hands
