## Vampires
### Abstract
Vampires are humans that have escaped a near-death experience and become unaging and semi-immortal.

### Description
Vamprires are created when a dying human is fed the blood of a vampire[^Where did the first vampire come from?]. After a period of time, they reanimate retaining their personality and memories, but may be in blood thrall to the vampire that created them. They no longer breathe and their heart does not beat, and gain extraordinary power and become very difficult to kill. Outside of the shallowing, they cannot eat or drink and cannot be exposed to the sun, but in Arthorne they can eat and get by leaving minimal uncovered skin. 

Vampires drink the blood of other beings, and use this blood to fuel their extraordinary phenomena. The act of drinking is done by biting open the drinkee (the cartidoid or jugular arteries) with retractable fangs, then lapping up the resulting blood. The saliva of a vampire has coagulant properties[^lick and slap?] and thus the wound closes naturally upon finishing feeding. This act is notably pleasant for both the drinker and the drinkee.

### Politics and organization
Vampires organize themselves in a feudal hierarchy parallel to our own, but with human populations instead of farmlands^[Who is our local ruler]. Arthorne is going through a period of unclear succession, but in a relatively stable manner.
