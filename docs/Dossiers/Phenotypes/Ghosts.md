## Ghosts
### Abstract
Ghosts are spirits of the deceased that do not move on to the afterlife.

### Description
After death, one may remain on this mortal plane as a ghost. Individuals who become ghosts retain their memory, personality and goals, but are by default intangible and no longer have corporeal needs. Many ghosts can manifest themselves as a regular person for a limited period of time[^Inferred from conversation, needs confirming]. They may also look deathly, especially if they died a violent death.

### Becoming a ghost
It's unknown what exactly causes the departed to become a ghost. However, when they first wake up on the other side, new ghosts seem to be in a state of amnesia and dullness; childlike almost.

### Politics and Organization
Ghosts have organized themselves into an empire that spans all of Europa. I know little of the specific organization, but it seems to have roots to the Roman Empire of antiquity; A significant number of ghosts in Arthorne belong to the 14th legion of Stygia[^How closely do these legions map to the practices of the legions in antiquity? A larger-than-sustainable proportion of local ghosts seem to belong to the legion-- though I suppose ghosts do not need to farm food to eat.]. Notably, the legion (and presumably the wider empire) is recognized as a soverign entity by our local Baron[^What laws are there on the other side?].

The majority of ghosts belong to one of four legions, distinguished by manner of death. 
- The Iron Legion takes those that die of old age
- The Skeletal Legion takes those that die of disease
- The Grim Legion takes those who
Throwaway lines about differing legions "fighting" over new recruits does imply that these legions are more social constructs and less artifacts of natural law.
