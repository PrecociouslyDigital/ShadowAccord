## "Woofies"
### Abstract
There is a secretive Supernatural Phenotype in Arthorne, likely related to Animals in some way.

### Description
There is another Supernatural Phenotype in Arthorne, of which I know little. This appears to be intentional, with multiple contacts telling me that it is not their secret to tell me of them when forced to allude to their existience. They appear to be comfortable with using violence to enforce this secrecy. I have heard them refered to as "Woofies" in a derogatory manner, so I assume that there is some relation to animals, but details remain sparse.

### Politics and Organization
The fact that there is a consistent unwillingness to speak of this group implies some level of coordination and community, if not explicit organization.
