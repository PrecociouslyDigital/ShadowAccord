## Blood Thrall
### Abstract
Vampires can enthrall others with their blood. Humans in particular gain powers beyond the mortal ken.

### Description
Anyone that drinks the blood of a vampire becomes betwitched and infactuated with the vampire in question ^[Does this work on ghosts?]. Affected individuals will have generally positive feelings towards the specific vampire, and will take small actions to see and help the source of their drink of their own initiative. Drinking that same vampire's blood a second time will solidify this bond; the affected individual becomes nearly incapable of seeing their liege in a negative light. They will never take up arms against the vampire in question and will work to further the vampire's goals as if they were their own.

When an otherwise ordinary individual undergoes this process, they gain access to vampric extraordinary phenomena. These tend to be the same as those of the vampire that enthralled them, but they have the capacity to learn any vampiric powers.
