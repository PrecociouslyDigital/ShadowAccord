## Illusionary Demise
### Abstract
Demon worshippers in Arthorne can glamour others into believing they are being eaten by locusts. 

### Description
Demon worshippers in Arthorne can glamour others into believing they are being eaten by locusts. Conversations indicate that that the form the glamour takes depends on the demon the caster worships, but locusts are the only glamour I have personally witnessed. The pain and sensory overload makes it hard to do anything but scream and run while under the glamours effects. So far such glamours seem to have a short range and require line of sight, and cultists seem to place people under this glamour frequently but not by default, suggesting that it has a cost to the user but not a large one.

### Tactics
- Like most other disabling phenomenon this can be used to disable combatants temporarily for a defeat in detail.
- Unlike paralysis or other disabling phenomena, this phenomena is anything but quiet, meaning usage outside of combat is not recommended.

### Counterplay
- A strong will can think through the pain and panic to disprove the reality of the glamour, which causes it to be dispelled.
- Breaking line of sight is a useful technique to not get hit.
