In the evening of Saturday, the 14th of September, 1224, Cygnus the Judge held Court to try Cadiguan, cook at the Wandering Bear, on the theft of one silver knife from Dragomir. In attendence in addition to Cygnus and Cadiguan were Wesley in his capacity as Constable and Tiffany Foundling and Volk as Court Witnesses. Father Marcus was also in attendance.

Cygnus stated to the court that the guilt of the accused was not in question; there were many witnesses at the moment of theft and the knife was later found in the possessions of the accused. The accused pleads guilty and does not dispute that he committed the crime.

Cygnus notes that since the stolen property was returned, there is no compensation and the total fine for theft from a concious person is nine diner. At thirty minutes per three diner of time in jail, Cadiguan has served more than ninety minutes in jail and thus Cygnus sentences him to time served.

At this point Cadiguan is freed from restraints and is warned that further crimes will be met with harsher penalties. Cygnus then adjourns Court.
