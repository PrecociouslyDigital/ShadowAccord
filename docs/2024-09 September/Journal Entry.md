## September 1224
### 13th of September, 1224
The rainy season has made latest round of interviews the dampest and most miserable journey so far, and with naught but the same testimony to show for it. Thankfully I've finished following up on each missing person we've currently identified, and I can sit back down. It is an honest relief to see Arthorne after so long on the road; while the town hasn't replaced the abbey in my heart, it's definitely a warm and familiar place, despite my rude introduction. The company of my friends by the hearth in the tavern definitely doesn't hurt either. As I write this, Ren and Volk are here with me to attend the mysterious meeting with the tricksy stranger who left us riddles last festival-- We have a bit of time, not too much, which I will go and steam some buns for our little gathering as thanks.

A quick entry post-meeting; the meeting at the fort did not yield many results. Ren was called away briefly to help Father Marcus with an unspecified errand, so Azeleos joined us Once we got to the fort we found a man in mask congratulating us on solving the riddle. He described himself as a "collector of interesting persons," a description that was very reassuring and did not raise any questions whatsoever. Having passed his test, he invited us to join his secret society and engage in the exchange of knowledge, and presented us with a suspicious but delicious looking cheese and fruit spread^[Azeleos says that the grapes were pretty good]. I took the opportunity to question this masked individual about the demon cultists and "the Wyrm", but didn't really learn anything new.^[On the way back we saw Cadiguan running past us at full tilt. No idea what that was about. ]

It is now well past midnight as I commit this encounter to paper while it's still fresh in my memory. Tommorow is Market and it's going to be such a relief to take it easy and just do some shopping tommorrow. Good night!

Cadiguan got arrested?!?

---

Yes, Cadiguan was arrested at around 3 in the morning. People say he stole a silver knife from Draugmir at around three in the morning; he just snuck up on him and yanked it from his belt. I initially didn't believe that he'd do such a thing. bit after interviewing many witnesses and hearing a consistent story, I don't have much of a choice but to believe it. Concerningly, it seems that his actions have made him an enemy of The Barristers^[Note: Ask Ren about the Barristers so I can finish that dossier]. I don't know much about them but I hear murmurs that they're out for blood. Cadiguan is currently being held at the gaol in Ploermel. I'll need to... I'll need to make the trek to figure out what he learned and warn him about the threats to his life. Once more onto the road I suppose. 

Also people like the buns. I'll need to bring more next month.

Cadiguan is safe for now. Ironically, it seems that I'm the one who's in peril now. It turns out that he had followed our merry band Friday Evening, and overheard us talking about demons and vampires and the other things that go bump in the night. He understandably spooked, and decided to steal the knife and use it to pay for passage somewhere far away from here. I left him a coded warning and some stern words, and headed back to town to see if I could secure his release and general safety. Unfortunately on the way back, I walked through an archway that seems to have turned me into a ghost of some kind; I now pass through solid objects and many appear to not be able to see or hear me. I don't see my body, which leads me to hope that this change is not. permanent. Unfortunately I have only a handful of victuals and half a canteen of water, and am at a loss for how to procure more in this... ethereal state, so my temporary ghostness may evolve to become a permanent state if I can't solve this problem. 

---

I've managed to escape my ethereal state! Unfortunately I'm not sure how I did it; I remember talking to Wick and some spirits of curiosity, then I got really dizzy and I could touch things again, just in time for dinner! I didn't make any progress on helping Cadiguan, but fortunately Father Marcus has been... busy. After dinner I went with Father Marcus, Constable Wesley, Judge Cyrus and Volk to retrieve Cadiguan from the Gaol. Cyrus appointed me a court witness and we had a trial where Cadiguan was sentenced to time served. Father Marcus then Blood Thralled Cadiguan^[see notes from conversation with Ren], which was part of the deal that would keep him safe from the Barristers.

Turns out ghosts can make treaties. The tavern this morning was host to negotiations between representatives of the Baron and representatives of The Legion, which is apparantly the earthly (or ghostly) authority on the other side^[Note: Get that heraldry to Wesley by next Market]. Cadiguan also seems to have mostly recovered from his ordeal; he's currently manning his shop. I think I'll go see how he's doing. We might take a stroll around town.

I hate this town. You'd think we can walk around town on the morning of the Lord's Sabbeth without freaking shit happening but no. Not only do we suddenly find ourselves on the top of the tower with no memory of how we got here, but moments after that we find a dismembered body in the woods. The smell.... the memory lingers in my mind as if it were making up for the memories that we lost shortly before that. Not only that but upon returning to Church service, not only was there an attack on the town by some bronze, fire-breathing bull, but Nora has the audacity to be Drunk. At Service on a sunday! I could just *throttle* her... but I won't. Because I am a good Christian. I will turn the other cheek. 

The upside is this has to be the last thing to happen this weekend and I will be able to enjoy my rest on the Sabbeth.

Fuck the swamp.
