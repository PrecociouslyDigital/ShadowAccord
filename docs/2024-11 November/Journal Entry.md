It's finally done! Copying the Report on Local Heraldry has resulted in a thankless month of tedium and copying, but I've finished just in time to properly enjoy the Festival of Above and Below instead of being trapped behind an inkwell. I would have gone mad had I not had a new cipher to play around with^[The cipher has been a tough nut to crack but I think I'm almost there; I need a couple details from the original which is in Cadiguan's posession]. There's still a couple hours before the festivities begin this evening, just enough time for a nap, which I will gladly take.

I--

I almost died tonight. Twice. Ended tonight by an oversized chicken, of all things. At least, that's what I thought Cygnus was fighting outside the Inn this evening. The chicken was after his cousin; at least, that's what I can gather, since she was already unconcious on the ground when I arrived on the scene. I don't regret fighting to protect others but.

I should go find Father Marcus.

Hello dear journal, you're finally back in my hands! I don't remember exactly what happened since my last entry, but I remember going to Silver Peaks to do some... investigation, and the next thing I remember is that I'm surrounded by all the barristers^[make sure to go over the importance of setting the stage before memory manipulation with Ren]. I didn't stick around to figure out exactly what I had done, but in my escape I must have lost my journal. There was nothing I could do about it though, so I went to bed.

This morning I woke up bright and early to set up my bun stand. It was a relatively slow morning so I passed the time deciphering that code Cadiguan and I found in Ploermel. Around noon I went down to the academy; I'd originally gone just to learn Archery from Edric, but while I was there I taught some people how to read and write as well. After another couple bun sales, I went to Reading Leaves for a lesson in what it meant to be a Deathwalker^[see notes for more details]. Teaching. After that, I went back to the Wandering Bear to sell more buns.

Around 4 I finally fully decoded that coded message. It read
> TAUPUNT UNGUARDED [LeBourgne] GUARD DOESN[']T LEA[V]E PLOERMEL HARVEST WILL BE GOO[D] DISCONTENT [W]ITH BANDIT T[R]OUBLES ANGE[L]IE RUMORS SP[R]EAD A PLUS
The harvest probably referred to the attack on Ploermel by the house of Roan, which involved confiscation of tools and foodstuffs from the town. The house of Roan must have a spy in Ploermel, and while the warning came too late for Taupont, the LeBorgnes should probably know that someone is in their capitol passing information to their enemies. I headed off the Ploermel to inform them, but their guard corp had not been paid in some time, and much of the family was absent. They were thankful for the information, but could not act on it in any meaningful way. Instead they directed me to coordinate and inform the constable and  other town leaders about the threat.

I managed to make it back from Plormel in time for dinner. The Barristers approached me at dinner, and we managed to come to an agreement. They promised to return this journal later that night, which they did. When they did so, they also tested me to see if I was distantly related to them, but it appears that I am not, but that was much later. 

Tonight was also Father Marcus' birthday. He had a lovely party in the brewery^[Cadiguan made a delightful set of cupcakes]. However, as I was leaving the party, a strange man approached me behind the tavern. He seemed scared, but the moment I got close to him, he touched me and I passed out. When I came to, I was recieving enchanced medical attention on the floor of the tavern; apparantly he had dumped my limp body there^[Third near death experience in as many days...] and then bolted. I hired a mercenary new to town to accompany me while I tried to find my assailant/savior but we didn't have any luck, and so I cozied up by the tavern fire to write this entry. It is late enough that I have given up and will go to bed, and hopefully there will be more options in the morning.

When I woke up this morning, I realized that there was a characteristic discontinity in my memories from last night. After checking with Seth, the mercenary I hired, I learned that the man who attacked me last night was chased across the tavern lawn and downed by some sort of lawman; when I attempted to intervene, I got into a shouting match with that pursuer and Lorcana, who wiped my memories. It is good that I am no longer at risk of exsanguination, but I would very much Lacking any other leverage, I think I will move to press charges with the constable, as Lorcana had used magic on me without my consent. Hopefully this is a big enough stick that I can get some answers out of her. At the very least this kind of behavior cannot become acceptable or commonplace. I'd like answers, but consequences might have to be enough

The threat of pressing charges was enough. In exchange for dropping the charges, Lorcana will have dinner with me to answer my questions and assuage my concerns^[I should ask Cadiguan about catering this. Something meaty and rare I think, to go with some other surprises I might source.]. We've scheduled it for the Festival weekend in January.
