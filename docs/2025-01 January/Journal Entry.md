Cyrus really does sell everything; I find myself the proud owner of two vials of grade A vampire blood. I've confirmed that this won't give the consumer an Oath of any kind, just a bit of a noticible pick-me-up, so the preparations for dinner are done. Hopefully this will be a nice warning to Lordana that her people aren't the only ones with fangs, but not escalate beyond that. Until then though, I think I'll take a nap; the cold demands a warm blanket to keep it at bay.

There was a large attack on the town today. I only heard about it secondhand, as I was... in the middle of a nap. From the tidbits I can get out of the rest of the town, it appears to have been evil ghosts of some kind. The fight was mostly out by the fort, and while there were injuries, there appears to have been only one death. Maybe. Thorne is gone and no one is sure whether he's coming back. Dinner is in an hour, I should find Cadiguan and let him know about timings and getting people in place.

Dinner went. About as well as can be expected. Lordana brought Vigo as her senechal, and Ren stood in for Father Marcus. While cross-checking the food and drink in the kitchen beforehand, I uncorked the vial of vitae and got hit with a horrific scent of rot and decay; I think these vials are tainted, which makes me wonder where Mr. Grim got a bunch of tainted vampire blood. Soul-sickening an influential town leader seemed like a *terrible* idea though, and dinner was soon, so I swapped the blood for a healing potion and went on with all other preparations.

The steak itself was delicious and well worth the coin. Lordana didn't seem surprised by the additions to her meal, so that gambit didn't pay off, but she didn't press me on it, so I think I won't be seeing any consequences for that little play either.^[Vigo checked his meal for poisons, seemingly by habit, but Lordana didn't do any checking that I could see. A supernatural phenomenon? Either way, it's good information that plays like that probably won't work on her going forward.] The conversation itself was productive, and we seem to have come to an agreeable accord. Lordana did apologize and as long as we don't have a repeat of what happened in November, long may she reign.

Unfortunately, as productive as dinner was, we were rudely interrupted by a delegation from the House of Roan, lead by one of the Roan boys^[I shouldn't call him a boy; he's probably older than I am. It's hard not to get that impression though.], announcing that they would be taking over the town and asking us to please not resist. They listed off a bunch of grieviences, some real, some manufactured, and promised us the town would be untouched if we didn't resist. After discussion with the rest of the town officials, it seems that right now, policy is nonresistance unless expressly commanded otherwise by the LeBorgnes, to avoid bringing unnessacary conflict and destruction to the town. Ren mentioned that he would *love* more visibility into the true intentions of the House of Roan, and if there's anything more nefarious behind their play for power. With all their efforts to win over the populace, I wonder if they'd be willing to accept a minor town official, seemingly snubbed in prestige and power, to help ensure the cooperation of the town... We'll see if there's anything that can come of that.

Volk was killed last night. There was an attack at the Lady's Lodge that ended with Volk and Cyrus dead^[Also Azeleos died? I'm not sure about that but if he did I hope he doesn't stay dead. He usually doesn't though.]. 

I. I don't

I should figure out where the bodies are. Maybe take a look. Lots of people seem to "die" and come back in this town.

If he really was. Murdered. I'll need to look for clues. I was supposed to ask Cyrus about the tainted blood. Don't know how I'll do that now. Maybe there's something in his wares?^[The wares were buried by Cadiguan. Dead end for now]

I--
