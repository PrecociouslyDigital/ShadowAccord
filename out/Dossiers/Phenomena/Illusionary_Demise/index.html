<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Demon worshippers in Arthorne can glamour others into believing they
are being eaten by locusts. Conversations indicate that that the form
the glamour takes depends on the demon the caster worships, but locusts
are the only glamour I have personally witnessed. The pain and sensory
overload makes it hard to do anything but scream and run while under the
glamours effects. So far such glamours seem to have a short range and
require line of sight, and cultists seem to place people under this
glamour frequently but not by default, suggesting that it has a cost to
the user but not a large one.</p>

<h3>Tactics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Like most other disabling phenomenon this can be used to disable
combatants temporarily for a defeat in detail.</li>
<li>Unlike paralysis or other disabling phenomena, this phenomena is
anything but quiet, meaning usage outside of combat is not
recommended.</li>
</ul>

<section id="counterplay" class="level3">
<h3>Counterplay</h3>
<ul>
<li>A strong will can think through the pain and panic to disprove the
reality of the glamour, which causes it to be dispelled.</li>
<li>Breaking line of sight is a useful technique to not get hit.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Further research needed</strong></strong></li>
