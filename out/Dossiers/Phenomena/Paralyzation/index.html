<h2>Paralyzation</h2>
<section id="abstract" class="level3">
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Sorcerers in Arthorne have the ability to wipe recent memories with a
touch. There are no recorded instances of memories being edited, wiped
after a duration or from range, though it’s hard to disprove such
powers. It’s possible to notice discrepencies, usually right after
awakening from sleep.</p>

<section id="description" class="level3">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sorcerers in Arthorne are able to manifest a phenomena by touching
their target that will cause someone to forget an entire period of time.
The affected subject loses up to ten minutes of memory, with the
subjective experience being almost indistinguishable from having briefly
lost your train of thought. This phenomena, like most phenomena
manifested by sorcerers, likely has some cost to the caster, but from
its liberal application I suspect that the cost is minimal.</p>
</section>
<section id="tactics" class="level3">
<h3>Tactics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Part of what keeps The Veil intact in Arthorne is liberal
application of this phenomena to plug unintentional leaks of
information, but this is the least interesting application and is
largely unnecessary assuming “optimal play”.</li>
<li>Applying it in a situation under friendly control allows liberal
“retries” of social situations; different approaches to questioning or
persuasion can be attempted to steer the outcome of a conversation
towards its “optimal” outcome.</li>
<li>While largely useless in the heat of combat, the brief
disorientation can be used to disorient a subject for flight or for
incapacitation.</li>
</ul>

<section id="counterplay" class="level3">
<h3>Counterplay</h3>
<ul>
<li>Written records are entirely unaffected by this phenomenon, and thus
important information should be immediately recorded.
<ul>
<li>Systems to detect tampering with my own records, while invaluable,
are beyond the scope of this entry<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Need to figure this out sooner rather than later!<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deciding on an action to take when when memory manipuation is
possible may help detect instances of the phenonmenon in the moment:
Something like biting one’s lip in a specific way or grabbing hold of a
specific object.
<ul>
<li>While this doesn’t stop the phenonmenon from taking hold, noticing
these details without being able to recall implementing them suggests
that the phenomenon has occured to me recently.</li>
<li>For obvious reasons I will not record my specific action in these
notes, but to anyone who reads this: know that I do employ this
technique and do not attempt to alter my memories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While often too delayed to be of immediate use, careful examination
of memories for discontinuties in location or situation without
explaination of the interval suggest that the phenomenon has occured.
<ul>
<li>Something about sleep “resets” the mind to be more attentive to
these details, but also memories naturally fade in time. I should get
into the habit of reviewing the previous day at dawn after I wake, as by
its very nature it’s difficult to know when such phenomenon have occured
the previous day.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Users</h3>
<p>Known sorcerers should be assumed to possess this phenomenon until
evidence suggests otherwise. As this phenomenon affects memory, all
known users will be listed in this section as a precaution. - Ren -
