<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Vampires can enthrall others with their blood. Humans in particular
gain powers beyond the mortal ken.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Anyone that drinks the blood of a vampire becomes betwitched and
infactuated with the vampire in question <span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Does this work on ghosts?<br />
<br />
</span></span>. Affected individuals will have generally positive
feelings towards the specific vampire, and will take small actions to
see and help the source of their drink of their own initiative. Drinking
that same vampire’s blood a second time will solidify this bond; the
affected individual becomes nearly incapable of seeing their liege in a
negative light. They will never take up arms against the vampire in
question and will work to further the vampire’s goals as if they were
their own.</p>
<p>When an otherwise ordinary individual undergoes this process, they
gain access to vampric extraordinary phenomena. These tend to be the
same as those of the vampire that enthralled them, but they have the
capacity to learn any vampiric powers.</p>
