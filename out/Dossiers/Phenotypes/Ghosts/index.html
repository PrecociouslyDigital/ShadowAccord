<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Ghosts are real and work mostly how you expect them to.</p>
</section>
<section id="description" class="level3">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>After death, one may remain on this mortal plane as a ghost.
Individuals who become ghosts retain their memory, personality and
goals, but are by default intangible and no longer have corporeal needs.
Many ghosts can manifest themselves as a regular person for a limited
period of time[^Inferred from conversation, needs confirming]. They may
also look deathly, especially if they died a violent death.</p>

<section id="politics-and-organization" class="level3">
<h3>Politics and Organization</h3>
<p>Ghosts have organized themselves into an empire that spans all of
Europa. I know little of the specific organization, but it seems to have
roots to the Roman Empire of antiquity; A significant number of ghosts
in Arthorne belong to the 14th legion of Stygia[^How closely do these
legions map to the practices of the legions in antiquity? A
larger-than-sustainable proportion of local ghosts seem to belong to the
legionâ€“ though I suppose ghosts do not need to farm food to eat.].
Notably, the legion (and presumably the wider empire) is recognized as a
soverign entity by our local Baron[^What laws are there on the other
side?].</p>
