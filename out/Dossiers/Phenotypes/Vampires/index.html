<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Vampires are humans that have escaped a near-death experience and
become unaging and semi-immortal.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Vamprires are created when a dying human is fed the blood of a
vampire[^Where did the first vampire come from?]. After a period of
time, they reanimate retaining their personality and memories, but may
be in blood thrall to the vampire that created them. They no longer
breathe and their heart does not beat, and gain extraordinary power and
become very difficult to kill. Outside of the shallowing, they cannot
eat or drink and cannot be exposed to the sun, but in Arthorne they can
eat and get by leaving minimal uncovered skin.</p>
<p>Vampires drink the blood of other beings, and use this blood to fuel
their extraordinary phenomena. The act of drinking is done by biting
open the drinkee (the cartidoid or jugular arteries) with retractable
fangs, then lapping up the resulting blood. The saliva of a vampire has
coagulant properties[^lick and slap?] and thus the wound closes
naturally upon finishing feeding. This act is notably pleasant for both
the drinker and the drinkee.</p>

<h3>Politics and organization</h3>
<p>Vampires organize themselves in a feudal hierarchy parallel to our
own, but with human populations instead of farmlands<span

succession, but in a relatively stable manner.</p>
