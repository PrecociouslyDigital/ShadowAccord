<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sorcerers is a descriptive term for any human who has manifested
extraordinary phenomena through replicable study (hereafter magick).
These practitioners command a wide and flexible range of phenomena, and
may teach any phenomena they have mastered to students. However, they
are physically mortal just like you or I, and have none of the
extraordinary resliance you may find from the other phenotypes.</p>

<h3>Politics and Organization</h3>
<p>Sorcerers are the most numerous Phenotype in Arthorne, but are also
the most fractured. The divergent ways people become sorcerers also
means that there is little common ground</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of largely pagan sorcerers gather often at the Rune and
Rod.</li>
<li>Another group appears to gather around the Healerâ€™s Guild.</li>
<li>Yet another group comprises many of the craftsmen in town.</li>
<li><del>The final group of paramilitary bent call themselves the
Barristers</del> The Barristers, while an organized group, are likely
mostly not sorcerers in the traditional sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making things even more confusing, membership in multiple clusters is
not just permitted but common, and many non-sorcerers also fall into
these clusters. It is likely most notable that there is not a single
political entity commanding the loyalties of all sorcerers like there is
for Ghosts and Vampires.</p>
