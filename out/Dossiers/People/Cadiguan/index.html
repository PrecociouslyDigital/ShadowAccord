<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Cadiguan is the tavern cook, one of the people new to town before me,
and as far as anyone can tell, completely mundane. Not only is he
completely mundane, but he exhibits “Delirium,” in which his mind enters
fight or flight mode whenever he directly witnesses any phenomena. This
both grants him speed and strength, but also causes his perception of
phenomena to warp such that he percieves mundane explainations for the
supernatural events. This is apparantly the default state for most of
those who cannot manifest phenomena themselves<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">why doesn’t this happen to me?<br />
<br />
</span></span>. Between this delirium, his incredible cooking and his
general good nature, most of the town sees him as someone to protect and
shield from the general goings on. I cannot discount myself as one of
these numbers, as he was the first friendly face when I came to
Arthorne.</p>
<p>He is known to be good at hiding in foliage, and is quiet as a mouse
while doing so.</p>
