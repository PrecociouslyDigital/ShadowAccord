<h3>11th of January, 1225</h3>
<p>Cyrus really does sell everything; I find myself the proud owner of
two vials of grade A vampire blood. I’ve confirmed that this won’t give
the consumer an Oath of any kind, just a bit of a noticible pick-me-up,
so the preparations for dinner are done. Hopefully this will be a nice
warning to Lordana that her people aren’t the only ones with fangs, but
not escalate beyond that. Until then though, I think I’ll take a nap;
the cold demands a warm blanket to keep it at bay.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was a large attack on the town today. I only heard about it
secondhand, as I was… in the middle of a nap. From the tidbits I can get
out of the rest of the town, it appears to have been evil ghosts of some
kind. The fight was mostly out by the fort, and while there were
injuries, there appears to have been only one death. Maybe. Thorne is
gone and no one is sure whether he’s coming back. Dinner is in an hour,
I should find Cadiguan and let him know about timings and getting people
in place.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dinner went. About as well as can be expected. Lordana brought Vigo
as her senechal, and Ren stood in for Father Marcus. While
cross-checking the food and drink in the kitchen beforehand, I uncorked
the vial of vitae and got hit with a horrific scent of rot and decay; I
think these vials are tainted, which makes me wonder where Mr. Grim got
a bunch of tainted vampire blood. Soul-sickening an influential town
leader seemed like a <em>terrible</em> idea though, and dinner was soon,
so I swapped the blood for a healing potion and went on with all other
preparations.</p>
<p>The steak itself was delicious and well worth the coin. Lordana
didn’t seem surprised by the additions to her meal, so that gambit
didn’t pay off, but she didn’t press me on it, so I think I won’t be
seeing any consequences for that little play either.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Vigo checked his meal for poisons, seemingly by habit,
but Lordana didn’t do any checking that I could see. A supernatural
phenomenon? Either way, it’s good information that plays like that
probably won’t work on her going forward.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The conversation itself was productive, and we seem to
have come to an agreeable accord. Lordana did apologize and as long as
we don’t have a repeat of what happened in November, long may she
reign.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as productive as dinner was, we were rudely
interrupted by a delegation from the House of Roan, lead by one of the
Roan boys<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">I shouldn’t call him a boy; he’s probably older than I
am. It’s hard not to get that impression though.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, announcing that they would be taking over the town and
asking us to please not resist. They listed off a bunch of grieviences,
some real, some manufactured, and promised us the town would be
untouched if we didn’t resist. After discussion with the rest of the
town officials, it seems that right now, policy is nonresistance unless
expressly commanded otherwise by the LeBorgnes, to avoid bringing
unnessacary conflict and destruction to the town. Ren mentioned that he
would <em>love</em> more visibility into the true intentions of the
House of Roan, and if there’s anything more nefarious behind their play
for power. With all their efforts to win over the populace, I wonder if
they’d be willing to accept a minor town official, seemingly snubbed in
prestige and power, to help ensure the cooperation of the town… We’ll
see if there’s anything that can come of that.</p>

<h3>12th of January, 1225</h3>
<p>Volk was killed last night. There was an attack at the Lady’s Lodge
that ended with Volk and Cyrus dead<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Also Azeleos died? I’m not sure about that but if he
did I hope he doesn’t stay dead. He usually doesn’t though.<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>I. I don’t</p>
<p>I should figure out where the bodies are. Maybe take a look. Lots of
people seem to “die” and come back in this town.</p>
<p>If he really was. Murdered. I’ll need to look for clues. I was
supposed to ask Cyrus about the tainted blood. Don’t know how I’ll do
that now. Maybe there’s something in his wares?<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">The wares were buried by Cadiguan. Dead end for
now<br />
