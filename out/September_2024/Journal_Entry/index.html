<h3>13th of September, 1224</h3>
<p>The rainy season has made latest round of interviews the dampest and
most miserable journey so far, and with naught but the same testimony to
show for it. Thankfully I’ve finished following up on each missing
person we’ve currently identified, and I can sit back down. It is an
honest relief to see Arthorne after so long on the road; while the town
hasn’t replaced the abbey in my heart, it’s definitely a warm and
familiar place, despite my rude introduction. The company of my friends
by the hearth in the tavern definitely doesn’t hurt either. As I write
this, Ren and Volk are here with me to attend the mysterious meeting
with the tricksy stranger who left us riddles last festival– We have a
bit of time, not too much, which I will go and steam some buns for our
little gathering as thanks.</p>
<hr />
<p>A quick entry post-meeting; the meeting at the fort did not yield
many results. Ren was called away briefly to help Father Marcus with an
unspecified errand, so Azeleos joined us Once we got to the fort we
found a man in mask congratulating us on solving the riddle. He
described himself as a “collector of interesting persons,” a description
that was very reassuring and did not raise any questions whatsoever.
Having passed his test, he invited us to join his secret society and
engage in the exchange of knowledge, and presented us with a suspicious
but delicious looking cheese and fruit spread<span

class="marginnote">Azeleos says that the grapes were pretty good<br />
<br />
</span></span>. I took the opportunity to question this masked
individual about the demon cultists and “the Wyrm”, but didn’t really
learn anything new.<span

class="marginnote">On the way back we saw Cadiguan running past us at full
tilt. No idea what that was about. <br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>It is now well past midnight as I commit this encounter to paper
while it’s still fresh in my memory. Tommorow is Market and it’s going
to be such a relief to take it easy and just do some shopping tommorrow.
Good night!</p>

<h3>14th of September, 1224</h3>
<p>Cadiguan got arrested?!?</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, Cadiguan was arrested at around 3 in the morning. People say he
stole a silver knife from Draugmir at around three in the morning; he
just snuck up on him and yanked it from his belt. I initially didn’t
believe that he’d do such a thing. bit after interviewing many witnesses
and hearing a consistent story, I don’t have much of a choice but to
believe it. Concerningly, it seems that his actions have made him an
enemy of The Barristers<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Note: Ask Ren about the Barristers so I can finish that
dossier<br />
<br />
</span></span>. I don’t know much about them but I hear murmurs that
they’re out for blood. Cadiguan is currently being held at the gaol in
Ploermel. I’ll need to… I’ll need to make the trek to figure out what he
learned and warn him about the threats to his life. Once more onto the
road I suppose.</p>
<p>Also people like the buns. I’ll need to bring more next month.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cadiguan is safe for now. Ironically, it seems that I’m the one who’s
in peril now. It turns out that he had followed our merry band Friday
Evening, and overheard us talking about demons and vampires and the
other things that go bump in the night. He understandably spooked, and
decided to steal the knife and use it to pay for passage somewhere far
away from here. I left him a coded warning and some stern words, and
headed back to town to see if I could secure his release and general
safety. Unfortunately on the way back, I walked through an archway that
seems to have turned me into a ghost of some kind; I now pass through
solid objects and many appear to not be able to see or hear me. I don’t
see my body, which leads me to hope that this change is not. permanent.
Unfortunately I have only a handful of victuals and half a canteen of
water, and am at a loss for how to procure more in this… ethereal state,
so my temporary ghostness may evolve to become a permanent state if I
can’t solve this problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve managed to escape my ethereal state! Unfortunately I’m not sure
how I did it; I remember talking to Wick and some spirits of curiosity,
then I got really dizzy and I could touch things again, just in time for
dinner! I didn’t make any progress on helping Cadiguan, but fortunately
Father Marcus has been… busy. After dinner I went with Father Marcus,
Constable Wesley, Judge Cyrus and Volk to retrieve Cadiguan from the
Gaol. Cyrus appointed me a court witness and we had a trial where
Cadiguan was sentenced to time served. Father Marcus then Blood Thralled
Cadiguan<span

the Barristers.</p>

<h3>15th of September, 1224</h3>
<p>Turns out ghosts can make treaties. The tavern this morning was host
to negotiations between representatives of the Baron and representatives
of The Legion, which is apparantly the earthly (or ghostly) authority on
the other side<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Note: Get that heraldry to Wesley by next Market<br />
<br />
</span></span>. Cadiguan also seems to have mostly recovered from his
ordeal; he’s currently manning his shop. I think I’ll go see how he’s
doing. We might take a stroll around town.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hate this town. You’d think we can walk around town on the morning
of the Lord’s Sabbeth without freaking shit happening but no. Not only
do we suddenly find ourselves on the top of the tower with no memory of
how we got here, but moments after that we find a dismembered body in
the woods. The smell…. the memory lingers in my mind as if it were
making up for the memories that we lost shortly before that. Not only
that but upon returning to Church service, not only was there an attack
on the town by some bronze, fire-breathing bull, but Nora has the
audacity to be Drunk. At Service on a sunday! I could just
<em>throttle</em> her… but I won’t. Because I am a good Christian. I
will turn the other cheek.</p>
<p>The upside is this has to be the last thing to happen this weekend
and I will be able to enjoy my rest on the Sabbeth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fuck the swamp.</p>
