<h1 class="title">Trial of Cadiguan</h1>
</header>
<p>In the evening of Saturday, the 14th of September, 1224, Cygnus the
Judge held Court to try Cadiguan, cook at the Wandering Bear, on the
theft of one silver knife from Dragomir. In attendence in addition to
Cygnus and Cadiguan were Wesley in his capacity as Constable and Tiffany
Foundling and Volk as Court Witnesses. Father Marcus was also in
attendance.</p>
<p>Cygnus stated to the court that the guilt of the accused was not in
question; there were many witnesses at the moment of theft and the knife
was later found in the possessions of the accused. The accused pleads
guilty and does not dispute that he committed the crime.</p>
<p>Cygnus notes that since the stolen property was returned, there is no
compensation and the total fine for theft from a concious person is nine
diner. At thirty minutes per three diner of time in jail, Cadiguan has
served more than ninety minutes in jail and thus Cygnus sentences him to
time served.</p>
<p>At this point Cadiguan is freed from restraints and is warned that
further crimes will be met with harsher penalties. Cygnus then adjourns
Court.</p>
