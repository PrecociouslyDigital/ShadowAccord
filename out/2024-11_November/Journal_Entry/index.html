<h3>15th of November, 1224</h3>
<p>It’s finally done! Copying the Report on Local Heraldry has resulted
in a thankless month of tedium and copying, but I’ve finished just in
time to properly enjoy the Festival of Above and Below instead of being
trapped behind an inkwell. I would have gone mad had I not had a new
cipher to play around with<span

class="marginnote">The cipher has been a tough nut to crack but I think
I’m almost there; I need a couple details from the original which is in
Cadiguan’s posession<br />
<br />
</span></span>. There’s still a couple hours before the festivities
begin this evening, just enough time for a nap, which I will gladly
take.</p>

<p>I–</p>
<p>I almost died tonight. Twice. Ended tonight by an oversized chicken,
of all things. At least, that’s what I thought Cygnus was fighting
outside the Inn this evening. The chicken was after his cousin; at
least, that’s what I can gather, since she was already unconcious on the
ground when I arrived on the scene. I don’t regret fighting to protect
others but.</p>
<p>I should go find Father Marcus.</p>

<h3>16th of November, 1224</h3>
<p>Hello dear journal, you’re finally back in my hands! I don’t remember
exactly what happened since my last entry, but I remember going to
Silver Peaks to do some… investigation, and the next thing I remember is
that I’m surrounded by all the barristers<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">make sure to go over the importance of setting the
stage before memory manipulation with Ren<br />
<br />
</span></span>. I didn’t stick around to figure out exactly what I had
done, but in my escape I must have lost my journal. There was nothing I
could do about it though, so I went to bed.</p>
<p>This morning I woke up bright and early to set up my bun stand. It
was a relatively slow morning so I passed the time deciphering that code
Cadiguan and I found in Ploermel. Around noon I went down to the
academy; I’d originally gone just to learn Archery from Edric, but while
I was there I taught some people how to read and write as well. After
another couple bun sales, I went to Reading Leaves for a lesson in what
it meant to be a Deathwalker<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">see notes for more details<br />
<br />
</span></span>. Teaching. After that, I went back to the Wandering Bear
to sell more buns.</p>
<p>Around 4 I finally fully decoded that coded message. It read &gt;
TAUPUNT UNGUARDED [LeBourgne] GUARD DOESN[’]T LEA[V]E PLOERMEL HARVEST
WILL BE GOO[D] DISCONTENT [W]ITH BANDIT T[R]OUBLES ANGE[L]IE RUMORS
SP[R]EAD A PLUS The harvest probably referred to the attack on Ploermel
by the house of Roan, which involved confiscation of tools and
foodstuffs from the town. The house of Roan must have a spy in Ploermel,
and while the warning came too late for Taupont, the LeBorgnes should
probably know that someone is in their capitol passing information to
their enemies. I headed off the Ploermel to inform them, but their guard
corp had not been paid in some time, and much of the family was absent.
They were thankful for the information, but could not act on it in any
meaningful way. Instead they directed me to coordinate and inform the
constable and other town leaders about the threat.</p>
<p>I managed to make it back from Plormel in time for dinner. The
Barristers approached me at dinner, and we managed to come to an
agreement. They promised to return this journal later that night, which
they did. When they did so, they also tested me to see if I was
distantly related to them, but it appears that I am not, but that was
much later.</p>
<p>Tonight was also Father Marcus’ birthday. He had a lovely party in
the brewery<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Cadiguan made a delightful set of cupcakes<br />
<br />
</span></span>. However, as I was leaving the party, a strange man
approached me behind the tavern. He seemed scared, but the moment I got
close to him, he touched me and I passed out. When I came to, I was
recieving enchanced medical attention on the floor of the tavern;
apparantly he had dumped my limp body there<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">Third near death experience in as many days…<br />
<br />
</span></span> and then bolted. I hired a mercenary new to town to
accompany me while I tried to find my assailant/savior but we didn’t
have any luck, and so I cozied up by the tavern fire to write this
entry. It is late enough that I have given up and will go to bed, and
hopefully there will be more options in the morning.</p>

<h3>17th of November, 1224</h3>
<p>When I woke up this morning, I realized that there was a
characteristic discontinity in my memories from last night. After
checking with Seth, the mercenary I hired, I learned that the man who
attacked me last night was chased across the tavern lawn and downed by
some sort of lawman; when I attempted to intervene, I got into a
shouting match with that pursuer and Lorcana, who wiped my memories. It
is good that I am no longer at risk of exsanguination, but I would very
much Lacking any other leverage, I think I will move to press charges
with the constable, as Lorcana had used magic on me without my consent.
Hopefully this is a big enough stick that I can get some answers out of
her. At the very least this kind of behavior cannot become acceptable or
commonplace. I’d like answers, but consequences might have to be
enough</p>
<hr />
<p>The threat of pressing charges was enough. In exchange for dropping
the charges, Lorcana will have dinner with me to answer my questions and
assuage my concerns<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle">*</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote">I should ask Cadiguan about catering this. Something
meaty and rare I think, to go with some other surprises I might
source.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. We’ve scheduled it for the Festival weekend in
January.</p>
